# DogBreedClassifier

** This App will be availabe on the app store soon! **

Use CoreML and Vision to detect dog breeds and find those types of dogs for adoption near you

Train and Test the model using the DogMLClassifier repository in my account and follow the instructions there.

Once the model is created, drag it into your project in Xcode, and make sure that the target is checked. 
Now, build the app and it is ready to go!
